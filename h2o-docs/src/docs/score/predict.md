# Score: Predict

Models generated using H2O can be used to predict on new data. That
data must be in the same format as the data originally modeled on. For
instance, the data set must contain the same predictor columns, and
data should be consistent with the range of data orginially modeled.

**Model**
The key associated with the model to be used in prediction

**Data**
The data on which to predict. This data must be parsed into H2O
prior to requesting a prediction.

**Prediction**
An optional user specified name for the returned prediction results.
