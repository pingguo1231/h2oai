# H2O on EC2

The H2O platform is tested nightly in EC2
for both single-node and multi-node configurations.

For users who want to quickly give H2O a try, we provide
an Amazon Machine Image to serve as an easy starting point.

The README.txt file embedded below describes scripts that can be found
in the EC2 directory of the downloadable zip file
(see [Getting Started](../tutorials/start)), or in the EC2 directory of the
Github repository https://github.com/0xdata/h2o/tree/master/ec2
