# Using h2o-dev from R


## Downloading

We don't yet have a downloadable R artifact for h2o-dev.
You have to build it yourself.


## Building it yourself

The R package is built as part of the normal build process.
In the top-level h2o-dev directory use `$ ./gradlew build`.

To build the R component by itself, first type `$ cd h2o-r` and then type `$ ../gradlew build`.

The output of the build is an CRAN-like layout in the R directory.


## Installation

### 1.  Installation from the command line

\# Make sure your currrent directory is the h2o-dev top directory.  
`$ R CMD INSTALL h2o-r/R/src/contrib/h2o_0.1.6.99999.tar.gz`

```

```

### 2.  Installation from within R

\# Detach any currently loaded H2O package for R.  
`if ("package:h2o" %in% search()) { detach("package:h2o", unload=TRUE) }`  

```
[ Output not interesting... ]
```

\# Remove any previously installed H2O package for R.  
`if ("h2o" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) { remove.packages("h2o") }`


```
[ Output not interesting... ]
```

\# Install the H2O R package from your build directory.  
`install.packages("h2o", repos=(c("file:///.../h2o-dev/h2o-R/R", getOption("repos"))))`  

```
Installing package into ‘/Users/tomk/.Rlibrary’

The downloaded binary packages are in
	/var/folders/tt/g5d7cr8d3fg84jmb5jr9dlrc0000gn/T//RtmpU2C3LG/downloaded_packages
```

## Running

### 1.  Start H2O from the command line

\# Make sure your currrent directory is the h2o-dev top directory.  
`$ java -jar h2o-app/build/libs/h2o-app.jar`

### 2.  Connect to H2O from within R

`library(h2o)`  

```
Loading required package: RCurl
Loading required package: bitops
Loading required package: rjson
Loading required package: statmod
Loading required package: tools

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Your next step is to start H2O and get a connection object (named
'localH2O', for example):
    > localH2O = h2o.init()

For H2O package documentation, first call init() and then ask for help:
    > localH2O = h2o.init()
    > ??h2o

To stop H2O you must explicitly call shutdown (either from R, as shown
here, or from the Web UI):
    > h2o.shutdown(localH2O)

After starting H2O, you can use the Web UI at http://localhost:54321
