\title{
Performance Measures
}
\description{
Evaluate the predictive performance of a model via various measures.
}
\usage{
h2o.performance(data, reference, measure = "accuracy", thresholds)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
  An \code{\linkS4class{H2OParsedData}} object containing the predicted outcome scores. Must be a single column with the same number of rows as \code{reference}.
  }
  \item{reference}{
  An \code{\linkS4class{H2OParsedData}} object containing the actual outcomes for comparison. Must be a single binary column with all entries in \{0,1\}.
  }
  \item{measure}{
  A character string indicating the performance measure to optimize. Must be one of the following: 
  \itemize{
      \item{\code{F1}: F1 score, equal to \eqn{2*(Precision*Recall)/{Precision + Recall}}}
      \item{\code{accuracy}: Accuracy of model, estimated as \eqn{(TP+TN)/(P+N)}.}
      \item{\code{precision}: Precision of model, estimated as \eqn{TP/(TP+FP)}.}
      \item{\code{recall}: Recall of model, i.e. the true positive rate \eqn{TP/P}.}
      \item{\code{specificity}: Specificity of model, i.e. the true negative rate \eqn{TN/N}.}
      \item{\code{max_per_class_error}: Maximum per class error in model.}
  }
  }
  \item{thresholds}{
  (Optional) A numeric vector from 0 to 1 indicating the threshold values at which to compute the performance measure. If missing, the range will be automatically generated.
  TODO: Still not sure I understand what exactly these thresholds are, is it the FPR or something else?
  }
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\linkS4class{H2OPerfModel}} with slots cutoffs, measure, perf (the performance measure selected), roc (data frame used to plot ROC) and model, where the last is a list of the following components:
\item{auc }{Area under the curve.}
\item{gini }{Gini coefficient.}
\item{best_cutoff }{Threshold value that optimizes the performance measure.}
\item{F1 }{F1 score at best cutoff.}
\item{accuracy }{Accuracy value at best cutoff.}
\item{precision }{Precision value at best cutoff.}
\item{recall }{Recall value at best cutoff.}
\item{specificity }{Specificity value at best cutoff.}
\item{max_per_class_err }{Maximum per class error at best cutoff.}
\item{confusion }{Confusion matrix at best cutoff.}
}
