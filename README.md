H2O
========

H2O makes Hadoop do math! H2O scales statistics, machine learning and math over BigData. H2O is extensible and users can build blocks using simple math legos in the core. H2O keeps familiar interfaces like R, Excel & JSON so that BigData enthusiasts & experts can explore, munge, model and score datasets using a range of simple to advanced algorithms. Data collection is easy. Decision making is hard. H2O makes it fast and easy to derive insights from your data through faster and better predictive modeling. H2O has a vision of online scoring and modeling in a single platform.

Product Vision for first cut
------------------------------
H2O product, the Analytics Engine will scale Classification and Regression.
- RandomForest, Generalized Linear Modeling (GLM), logistic regression, k-Means, available over R / REST / JSON-API
- Basic Linear Algebra as building blocks for custom algorithms
- High predictive power of the models
- High speed and scale for modeling and scoring over BigData

Data Sources
- We read and write from/to HDFS, S3, NoSQL, SQL
- We ingest data in CSV format from local and distributed filesystems (nfs)
- A JDBC driver for SQL and DataAdapters for NoSQL datasources is in the roadmap. (v2)

Console provides Adhoc Data Analytics at scale via R-like Parser on BigData
 - Able to pass and evaluate R-like expressions, slicing and filters make this the most powerful web calculator on BigData

Users
--------------------------------
Primary users are Data Analysts looking to wield a powerful tool for Data Modeling in the Real-Time. Microsoft Excel, R, SAS wielding Data Analysts and Statisticians.
Hadoop users with data in HDFS will have a first class citizen for doing Math in Hadoop ecosystem.
Java and Math engineers can extend core functionality by using and extending legos in a simple java that reads like math. See package hex.
Extensibility can also come from writing R expressions that capture your domain.

Design
--------------------------------

We use the best execution framework for the algorithm at hand. For first cut parallel algorithms: Map Reduce over distributed fork/join framework brings fine grain parallelism to distributed algorithms.
Our algorithms are cache oblivious and fit into the heterogeneous datacenter and laptops to bring best performance.
Distributed Arraylets & Data Partitioning to preserve locality.
Move code, not data, not people.

Extensions
---------------------------------

One of our first powerful extension will be a small tool belt of stats and math legos for Fraud Detection. Dealing with Unbalanced Datasets is a key focus for this.
Users will use JSON/REST-api via H2O.R through connects the Analytics Engine into R-IDE/RStudio.

Building H2O Dev
--------------------------------

Getting started with H2O development requires JDK 1.7, Node.js, and Gradle.  We use the Gradle wrapper ( gradlew ) to ensure an up-to-date local version of Gradle and other dependencies are installed in your development directory.

### Setup on Windows

Step 1. Install JDK

Install [Java 1.7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) and add the appropriate directory `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_65\bin` with java.exe to PATH in Environment Variables. Check to make sure the command prompt is detecting the correct Java version by running:

    javac -version


Step 2. Install Node.js and npm

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) and add installed directory `C:\Program Files\nodejs` that should include node.exe and npm.cmd to PATH if it isn't already prepended.


Step 3. Git Clone [h2o-dev](https://github.com/0xdata/h2o-dev.git)

If you don't already have a Git client, please install one.  The default one can be found here http://git-scm.com/downloads .  Make sure that during the install command prompt support is turned on.

Download and update h2o-dev source codes:

    git clone https://github.com/0xdata/h2o-dev

Step 4. Run the top-level gradle build:

    cd h2o-dev
    gradlew.bat build -x test

If you encounter errors run again with --stacktrace for more instructions on missing dependencies.

### Setup on OS X
If you don't have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) install, please consider it.  It makes package management for OS X easy.

Step 1. Install JDK

Install [Java 1.7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html). Check to make sure the command prompt is detecting the correct Java version by running:

    javac -version


Step 2. Install Node.js and npm

Using Hombrew:

    brew install node

Otherwise install from the [NodeJS website](http://nodejs.org/download/).

Step 3. Git Clone [h2o-dev](https://github.com/0xdata/h2o-dev.git)

OS X should have come with Git installed, so just download and update h2o-dev source codes:

    git clone https://github.com/0xdata/h2o-dev

Step 4. Run the top-level gradle build:

    cd h2o-dev
    ./gradlew build -x test

If you encounter errors run again with --stacktrace for more instructions on missing dependencies.

### Setup on Ubuntu 14.04

Step 1. Install Node.js and npm

    sudo apt-get install npm
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node


Step 2. Install JDK

Install [Java 1.7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html). Installation instructions can be found here [JDK installation](http://askubuntu.com/questions/56104/how-can-i-install-sun-oracles-proprietary-java-jdk-6-7-8-or-jre). Check to make sure the command prompt is detecting the correct Java version by running:

    javac -version

Step 3. Git Clone [h2o-dev](https://github.com/0xdata/h2o-dev.git)

If you don't already have a Git client,

    sudo apt-get install git

Download and update h2o-dev source codes:

    git clone https://github.com/0xdata/h2o-dev

Step 4. Run the top-level gradle build:

    cd h2o-dev
    ./gradlew build -x test

If you encounter errors run again with --stacktrace for more instructions on missing dependencies.

> Make sure that you are not running as root since `bower` will reject such a run

### Setup on Ubuntu 13.10

Step 1. Install Node.js and npm

On Ubuntu 13.10, the default Node.js (v0.10.15) is sufficient, but the default npm (v1.2.18) is too old, so we use a fresh install from the npm website.

    sudo apt-get install node
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
    wget http://npmjs.org/install.sh
    sudo apt-get install curl
    sudo sh install.sh

Step 2-4. Follow steps 2-4 for Ubuntu 14.04

### Setting up your preferred build environment

For the command-line developer:

    ./gradlew make
    make clean
    make
    
For users of Intellij's IDEAJ, project files can be generated with:

    ./gradlew idea

For users of Eclipse, project files can be generated with:

    ./gradlew eclipse
